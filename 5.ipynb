    "Question -2 .\n",
    "Ans- Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Procedural Programming: Python allows you to write programs using procedural programming techniques, where you organize code into procedures or functions that perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to create classes and objects, encapsulate data, and define methods to manipulate that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Functional Programming: Python includes features that support functional programming, such as first-class functions, lambda expressions, and functions as arguments or return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Imperative Programming: Python supports imperative programming, where you define a series of statements that change the program's state to accomplish a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of variables explicitly; the interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned to them."

    "Question -3. \n",
    "Ans - Yes, Python is case-sensitive when dealing with identifiers. This means that identifiers such as variable names, function names, class names, etc., must be typed consistently with the same case throughout your code. Python considers identifiers with different cases as different entities."

    "Question -5 \n",
    "Ans - \n",
    "Python is generally considered an interpreted language, but it's a bit more nuanced than that. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter. This means that you can write Python code and execute it without explicitly compiling it into machine code beforehand. The Python interpreter reads the code, parses it, and executes it directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bytecode Compilation: However, Python does involve a form of compilation. When you run a Python script or module, the Python interpreter first compiles the source code into bytecode. This bytecode is a low-level platform-independent representation of the source code. The bytecode is then executed by the Python virtual machine (PVM)."
